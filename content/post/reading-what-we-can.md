# Reading what we can - The gauntlet

While attending a [Apart research](https://www.apartresearch.com/) sprint / hackathon i got introduced by [Esben Kran](https://twitter.com/EsbenKC) to the "Reading what we can" challenge. This challenge has you reading a combination of 20 books and articles over 20 days for you given learning path, which in my case is the "ML engineering & AI safety path" as defined on the challenge website. The reason for the existence of this challenge is both to consume important material and learn from them, but more importantly to frame it as a challenge which makes the process of learning from all this material more digestible.

I will be updating my thoughts / small summary of each of the reading materials as i go trough them. I hope with this that I maybe can inspire someone to take on the challenge themselves or at least pick up some of the readings.
